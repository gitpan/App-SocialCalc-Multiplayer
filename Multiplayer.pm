=head1 NAME

App::SocialCalc::Multiplayer - Multiplayer SocialCalc Server with WebSocket

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Run this in a host computer:

    % sudo socialcalc-multiplayer.pl
    Accepting requests at http://0.0.0.0:9999/

Then connect to port 9999 with two or more browsers, and start collaboratively
edit a web-based spreadsheet.

The C<sudo> is needed for providing Flash-emulated support for non-WebSocket
browsers, which requires serving a policy file on port 843; if all clients
are already WebSocket-capable, then C<sudo> is not needed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a convenient bundle around a prototypical WebSocket-SocialCalc
integration hack, based on the demonstration in a YAPC::Tiny talk for Chupei.pm
during late October 2009.

The presentation slides are available at:
